<p>Katniss can see that the creatures are more muttations, giant wolves that move in an unnervingly human way. She follows Cato to the Cornucopia, 
    but as she’s about the climb, she remembers Peeta and turns to see him struggling on his bad leg. He tells her to go on, but she tries to help 
    him up the golden horn of the Cornucopia, fending off the mutts with her remaining arrows.

As Katniss and Peeta climb onto the golden horn, Katniss recognizes that the mutts each resemble one of the fallen tributes, and the thought 
terrifies her. She tries to think of how she can get to Cato to attack him, when she turns to see that Cato has Peeta in a headlock. Cato says 
that if Katniss shoots him in the head, he’ll take Peeta down with him. Peeta is quickly losing air, and Katniss is unsure what to do. 
Peeta raises his forearm to draw an X across Cato’s hand, and Katniss understands. She shoots Cato’s hand just as Peeta shoves him backwards. 
Katniss grabs Peeta before he can fall and they wait for Cato to die. Because he’s wearing protective body armor, however, the attack continues 
throughout the night, and Cato still isn’t dead.

In the morning, when Katniss sees Cato again, the muttations have left, but Cato is still alive. He’s a raw hunk of meat, and she sends an arrow to 
kill him more out of a sense of pity than competition. Still, after Cato dies, nothing changes in the arena. Katniss and Peeta move to the lake so 
that the hovercraft can retrieve Cato’s body, but even after that, nothing happens. Then an announcement comes on—the last revision to the rules 
has been revoked, and there can only be one winner to the Hunger Games.

    Katniss is shocked, and when she sees Peeta reaching for his knife, she automatically trains her last arrow on him. Peeta drops his knife in 
    the lake and tells her to go ahead, but Katniss is ashamed by her reaction and drops her weapons too. Peeta insists and says that there’s no 
    other way—the Capitol needs to have a victor. His words give Katniss an idea. She retrieves her pouch of poisoned berries, and she hands some 
    to Peeta and takes some herself. On the count of three, they agree to eat the berries and kill themselves. On three, as the berries cross 
    their lips, another frantic announcement comes on, telling them to stop. Katniss and Peeta are announced as the winners of the Hunger Games.
