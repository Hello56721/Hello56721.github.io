Katniss and Peeta spit out the berries and wash out their mouths in the lake. A hovercraft arrives, and Peeta is immediately taken to a separate room 
to be treated for his wounds. Katniss becomes panicked when he’s wheeled away, and somebody arrives to sedate her. When she comes to, she’s strapped 
into a hospitable bed, and there’s a meager meal before her. She realizes that her appetite has shrunk dramatically since the end of the Games. 
Katniss tries to leave, but then something enters her veins from an IV, and she’s knocked out again. This process repeats itself several more times 
before she wakes one day and is no longer strapped in.

    Katniss notices that her scars are all gone, and her hearing’s been repaired. She gets out of bed to meet her team, calling for Peeta when she 
    enters the hall. Effie’s voice responds instead, and Katniss runs to greet the team, surprisingly hugging Haymitch first. Katniss begins to 
    panic when she notices that Peeta isn’t there, but Haymitch assures her that it’s only because the Capitol wants to televise their reunion.

Katniss follows Cinna to get ready. He’s designed a very simple looking yellow dress that makes Katniss appear young and innocent. Katniss is aware 
that this must be designed with a particular reason in mind, but she can’t understand why yet.

When Haymitch greets Katniss again, he asks to give her a hug before the show begins. While he has her in an embrace, Haymitch whispers that the 
Capitol is very angry that she made them the laughingstock of Panem by using the berries to outwit them and force them to change the rules of the 
game. She’s in very grave danger unless she can convince them that she was so madly in love she couldn’t act otherwise. Haymitch also adds that he 
didn’t have to give Peeta the same memo—he’s already in love with her.

Katniss is very afraid, wondering how this might affect her family in District 12. She has many unanswered questions about the implications of their 
victory—but she has to set them aside for now, as she prepares to step into the most dangerous part of the Hunger Games yet.
