        <h2>What is Squares?</h2>
        Squares is a game where the player is a square with a happy face on
        it, and the player tries to touch a wooden crate. When the player 
        Touches the crate, the screen will say "You win"</p>

            Please note that this game was never meant to be played; I just created
            this for fun.
        </p></i>
